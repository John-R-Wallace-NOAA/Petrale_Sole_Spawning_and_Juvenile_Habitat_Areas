Steps used:

1) The Petrale sole Winter Fishery logbook data, 'LB.ShortForm.No.Hake.Strat 13 Apr 2017.RData', was obtained by following (an old version of) this repo:

      https://github.com/John-R-Wallace-NOAA/PacFIN_Logbook_Download_and_Cleanup

2) Thorson's [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST]) (consider using [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/) for new projects) was applied to the data using the code in:

       VAST Petrale CW NOCV Biomass Other Regions n_x = 300.R

3) The raw data (DatG) was compared with VAST grid results using bubble plots:

       Compare VAST Grid Results with DatG using Bubble plots.R

This code also outputs the plotted data using 'PlotResultsOnMap_Fn_JRW' which is a hacked version of Thorson's 'PlotResultsOnMap' function. 'Petrale.Results.Biomass.Stacked.Dpth.Rst' is that output row stacked [rbind()] by year.

4) The selected criteria define areas (within 'Petrale.Results.Biomass.Stacked.Dpth.Rst') of interest and the points and polygon results are output:

       Petrale Spatial Results Top 20, in at Least 40% Years Dpth Rst.R

In a multi-step iterative process the [INLA](www.r-inla.org) R package's inla.nonconvex.hull() function was first used to find a nonconvex hull for the points. The polyclip() function from the 'polyoffset' package was next employed to reduce the size of the polygons, and the adjustPolygon() function from my [Imap](https://github.com/John-R-Wallace-NOAA/Imap) package was utilized to move the polygon if needed.  The area was calculated with geosphere() from the 'areaPolygon' package.
   
The eleven defined Petrale sole spawning areas (an R list() of lists) are in this repo here:

       Polygon_Area_Results > Petrale AreaGroupsShare 11 Jan 2018.RData
       
Each spawning area within the list has the areas points (AreasPts) from the VAST grid and the estimated polygon that surrounds that area (Boundary).

The code that plots these areas in various ways starts around line 406 of 'Petrale Spatial Results Top 20, in at Least 40% Years Dpth Rst.R'. For convenience, a snippet of code that plots those areas in a simple way is given below:


     load('Petrale AreaGroupsShare 11 Jan 2018.RData')
     
     par(mfrow =c(2,2))
     
     for (G in 1:11) {
        AREA <- AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$AreasPts[,-3]
        Delta <- 0.04
        plot( AREA, xlim = c(min(AREA$X) - Delta, max(AREA$X) + Delta), ylim = c(min(AREA$Y) - Delta, max(AREA$Y) + Delta), 
                    main = paste("Res =", AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Resolution, "Convex =", AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Convex ))
        polygon(AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Boundary, col=col.alpha('purple', 0.25))
     }

Below is an example of using polyclip::polyoffset() to reduce the size of a polygon that was originally generated by inla.nonconvex.hull():

    
     lib(Imap)
     lib(polyclip)

     for (G in 9) {
         AREA <- AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$AreasPts[,-3]
         Delta <- 0.04
         plot( AREA, xlim = c(min(AREA$X) - Delta, max(AREA$X) + Delta), ylim = c(min(AREA$Y) - Delta, max(AREA$Y) + Delta), 
                     main = paste("Res =", AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Resolution, "Convex =", AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Convex ))
         polygon(AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Boundary, col = Imap::col.alpha('purple', 0.25))
         polygon(polyclip::polyoffset(list(x=AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Boundary$x[-1], 
               y=AreaGroupsShare[[G]]$Boundary$y[-1]), -0.014)[[1]], col = Imap::col.alpha('green', 0.25))
      }
